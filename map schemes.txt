environment and agent scheme

enviro:
map is dXd square matrix (list of lists)
place n mines at rand coordinates
coord is either mine (-1)
or is a number indicating num of mines touching (0-8)

basic agent (from section 2.1):
for each cell, keep track of
	mine or safe
	if safe, num mines touching
	num of safe squares identified (for sure) around it
	num of mines identified (for sure) around it
	num of hidden squres around it

general agent:
has its own "maps" representing what it knows
needs 4 agent maps
each cell of these four maps contains the following:
	1. mine/clue/unkown map
		mine = -1
		clue = num 0-8
		unknown = 9
	2. num safe squares identified (for sure) around it
		unknown = 9
		num safe = 0-8
	3. num mines identified (for sure) around it (ie flagged)
		unknown = 9
		num mines = 1-8
	4. num hidden squares around it
		unkown = 9
		num hidden = 0-8
