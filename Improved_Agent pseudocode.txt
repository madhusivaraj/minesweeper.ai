while not every cell has been queried or flagged
	# Choose new cell to query.
	if there are known safe cells
		choose one to query
	else
		choose cell that is least probable to be a mine
	
	# Process query and add new map knowledge to knowledge base.
	if it's a mine
		record it
	else
		note the number of safe cells, mines, and hidden cells around it
	
	# Perform logical inference and record derived knowledge in knowledge base.
	if all cells around a clue must be mines
		flag them all as mines
	if all cells around a clue must be safe
		mark them all as safe
	use DFS and constraint satisfaction to find every valid configuration of mines in the cells adjacent to clues
	average over these configurations to find the probability of a mine existing at each cell adjacent to the clues
